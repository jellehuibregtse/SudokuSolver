# Sudoku Solver
This is a sudoku solver using brute-force search and backtracking. Backtracking is a depth-first search.
"Although it has been established that approximately 5.96 x 1126 final grids exist, a brute force algorithm can be a practical method to solve Sudoku puzzles."

Advantages of this method are:
  - A solution is guaranteed (as long as the puzzle is valid).
  - Solving time is mostly unrelated to degree of difficulty.
  - The algorithm (and therefore the program code) is simpler than other algorithms, especially compared to strong algorithms that ensure a solution to the most difficult puzzles.
